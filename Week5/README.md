Title:
Pros and cons of Bayesian Methods in Parameter Identification

Abstract:
The Bayesian framework is popular for parameter fitting in statistical modelling, but it is also useful in other parameter identification problems. Furthermore, the Bayesian methodology is suitable to explore parameters in infinite dimensional spaces, for example time- or space-dependent parameters. However, the additional information provided by the Bayesian techniques comes at a price of higher computational cost. We present the main ideas of the method and explain where it stands among other data analysis tools. To illustrate the method, we present some results for parameter identification problems in mathematical biology.

# SDAF
Sussex Data Analysis Forum
---

 The Sussex Data Analysis Forum (SDAF) is a multidisciplinary platform for sharing advanced data analysis and machine learning knowledge within the University of Sussex. 
 
 In practice, the forum will discuss techniques and material suitable for researchers at or above postgraduate level. SDAF will provide a space for members to review and demonstrate their applications of statistical techniques, discuss high-level statistics problems, and share statistical expertise within the university. 
 
 A key outcome will be the exchange of statistical knowledge among SDAF members and exposure to a broader range of methodologies.

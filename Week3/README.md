Title: Untangling the physical components of galaxies

In my area of research, we use observational data to try and understand galaxies and how they evolve. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis, Non-Negative Matrix factorization and Gaussian Mixtures Modelling have been used to learn untangle tangle components in data. In this talk I will demonstrate how I used these techniques during my [PhD](http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/51433/) to 'learn' the physical components of galaxies from the data, and how they differ.

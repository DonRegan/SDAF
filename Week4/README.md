Title: Dataset Shift

Classification methods are typically tested on a test dataset that is from the same distribution as the training set. Performance in ‘real world’ situations frequently is not as good as in the lab. In this session I propose to cover:

1. An overview of the different types of dates shift (e.g. covariate shift, prior probability shift, domain shift etc.)
2. Some methods that have been applied to address problems of dataset shift (‘domain adaptation’, ’transduction')
